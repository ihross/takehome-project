Students have trouble keeping track of work that needs to get done. We believe that giving them somewhere to track this will help them. We are going to start by replicating the trello workflow!

To get an introduction into what Trello is like, look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xky48zyL9iA

Our trello has humble beginnings we just want to keep track of the following tracks:
* Saved
* Applied
* Interviewing
* Offer

# Entities
For now, the two objects we want to keep track of are:
* Cards - hold information on what the user is keeping track of
* Lists - organizes a list of cards
